 By completing this workshop, I was able to make use of the module concept that
 we learnt and implement it in the program, so I created a separate module and
 put the related functions in there. This way instead of putting all the codes
 in one file which makes it hard to review and debug later, everything will be
 more organized and easier to find. Another concept I learnt was using the
 safeguard technique for the header files to avoid duplication and the use
 of namespace and putting all the codes inside them. The second part of the
 workshop was about reading data from a text file and getting keywords from
 user to search for the related data and displaying it to the end user. Which
 I used the cStrTools module provided by the professor which would function
 like a c String library and I used the strcmp and toLowercaseAndCopy and strStr
 function which would return the address of the match found, and then we can
 display it to the user using it.
