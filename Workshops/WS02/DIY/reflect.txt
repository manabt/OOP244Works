This week I learned the concept of dynamic memory allocation and by completing
 this workshop I was able to implement this concept. Dynamic memory allocation
 is useful where you are not aware of the number of input or things read from 
a file, in these situation with dynamic memory allocation we have to allocate
 a size to an array and then check if that size is reached or not, and if it
 was, then we will create a temporary array with more size than the previous 
one and copy the previous array elements into the temporary one and then you
 will set the temporary array pointer to the previous array. But it is
 imperative that we delete the previous array before assigning it anything 
new to avoid memory leaks.
I also got familiar with references which is similar to pointers but object
 oriented and easier to use and it is known by the & symbol.
