 This week I learned about class member functions and variables and how to
 make them either public or private. To complete this workshop, I created
 a class with several member variables and member functions and these member
 functions each have direct access to other member variables and functions.
 The members of a class are private by default, so the client cannot have
 direct access to them, unlike the struct type members which are public by
 default. For clients to have access to the private members of the class I
 created public functions so they can access the private members indirectly
 through these functions. Some of the member functions in this workshop were
 queries which were only intended to display or validate the data, while
 other were modifier functions, which were responsible to change and modify
 the member variables of the class which were private, and the client could
 not change these variables directly. I also used the cout member function
 precision to set the decimal values to two and output the result to the screen.
