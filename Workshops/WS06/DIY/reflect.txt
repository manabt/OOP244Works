 I was able to implement the extraction and insertion operator in this workshop
 and to do so, I couldâ€™ve accomplished it by making it a friend to the class
 object or making it a helper function which I implemented it as a helper 
 function. A helper function does not have direct access to the private members
 of the class, so it must use other member functions in the class that are
 public to accomplish this task. We avoid using making a global function a
 friend to a class because this way we go against the concept of encapsulation
 which is the whole point of object-oriented programming. In this workshop I 
 also applied the rule of three, because the Name class had resources outside
 of the class scope and all the assignments needed to be take cared manually
 and memory allocated at the run time needed to be deallocated to avoid any
 memory leaks.
